| What happened to your files? 

--------------------------------------------

We breached your corporate network and encrypted the data on your computers. The encrypted data includes documents, databases, photos and more -

all were encrypted using a military grade encryption algorithms (AES-256 and RSA-2048). You cannot access those files right now. But dont worry!

You can still get those files back and be up and running again in no time. 


---------------------------------------------

| How to contact us to get your files back?

---------------------------------------------

The only way to restore your files is by purchasing a decryption tool loaded with a private key we created specifically for your network. 

Once run on an effected computer, the tool will decrypt all encrypted files - and you can resume day-to-day operations, preferably with

better cyber security in mind. If you are interested in purchasing the decryption tool contact us at bapcocrypt@ctemplar.com


-------------------------------------------------------

| How can you be certain we have the decryption tool?

-------------------------------------------------------

In your mail to us attach up to 3 files (up to 3MB, no databases or spreadsheets).

We will send them back to you decrypted.
